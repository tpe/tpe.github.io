<p><strong>Private equity teams live for the carry</strong> (carried interest). We get overly qualified at college, leave our own profitable ventures, accept meagre salaries, work our glutes off trying to close deals&#8230; all for the carry. Some equiteers (admittedly lower in the hierarchy), do it even for just the potential of carry (that is, they&#8217;re not yet signed up to carry, but one day hope to be).</p><p>Let&#8217;s look at a very simple example. Your private equity team runs a $100m fund with a 20% carry entitlement. There are four founding executives and eight investment executives. It&#8217;s likely that, let&#8217;s say, 25% of the carry is taken up by anchor investors, parent companies, previous founders/partners, etc. (Yes, when you leave a fund, <strong>often you are still entitled </strong>to accumulated carry on that fund.)</p><p>However, it&#8217;s important to look at private equity carry with a clear mind, one not too blinkered by riches. Moreover, in writing this post, <strong>I&#8217;m hoping that some of you aspiring private equity teams will enter the industry with carry at the bottom of the priority list</strong>. If you can do this, then you&#8217;ll be able to self-motivate even if your fund explodes and there&#8217;s no carry to go around.</p><p>The founders of the private equity team will take a large part of the remaining 75%, <strong>a very large part</strong>, and may leave the other eight executives with say 20%. As a newer member of the investment team, your entitlement is lower, so let&#8217;s say 1.5%. However, you don&#8217;t earn that 1.5% upon joining the team though; it will likely be broken up so you earn 0.15% per year for 10 years.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s say your fund has a 2% management fee. But, management fees are usually based on committed capital, which reduces as money is distributed back to investors. So, let&#8217;s say $15m in fees. That&#8217;s about $85m invested. If your team manages to double the investment (which isn&#8217;t unreasonable in the right environment), total carry will be $17m. In your first year that you earn 0.15%, <strong>that equals about $25k of carry</strong>.</p><p>If all goes well and you stay with the fund for 10 years, your total private equity carry will be $250k. For simplicity, if you get that in five equal repayments in the last five years of the fund and you use a discount rate of 15%, the PV of your carry is only about $50k. To be a little less conservative, add the nominal amount of $25k to your current salary of say $100k (this is PE remember), and your annual earnings, including carry, are $125k. <strong>This is a fairly typical scenario. </strong>Sure your fund could return 4x cash and you could have 10% of the carry, but these are extremes.</p><p>So, I&#8217;m not trying to dissuade new private equity teams, but rather put carry into context. My advice is that you<strong> make sure you&#8217;re in private equity for the right reasons</strong>: you like to do deals, deal with business owners, research different industries, etc. The money will follow if you have the passion for those things, but you&#8217;ll be sorely disappointed if you&#8217;re only entering for the carry. <strong>It still takes 10-15 years to run your own fund and make the real money</strong>, especially in mid-market.</p><p>Or, with the right background (started and sold a successful business, Ivy League MBA with summa or magna, etc), <strong>you may get a foothold into a large fund</strong> and become entitled to a smaller piece of a much bigger apple pie.</p>
