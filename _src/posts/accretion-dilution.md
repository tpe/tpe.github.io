p><em></em></p><p>The accretion/dilution concept refers to the impact an acquisition has on the buying firm&#8217;s Earnings Per Share (“EPS”). An acquisition is <strong>accretive</strong> when the combined EPS (known as pro forma EPS) is greater than the buyer&#8217;s standalone EPS. An acquisition is <strong>dilutive </strong>when pro forma EPS is less than the standalone EPS.</p><p>For example, suppose analysts expect 3M&#8217;s EPS to be $6.12 in 2011. If they were to acquire Company ABC, pro forma EPS in 2011 is now expected to be $6.18</p>
