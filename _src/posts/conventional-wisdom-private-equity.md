<<p>If there was one thing I learnt in all of my time in private equity that I think could help newcomers, it&#8217;s that conventional wisdom is about 90% convention and 10% wisdom. And that&#8217;s being especially generous.</p><p>In my first few months at my first PE firm, I heard all sorts of hyperbole, such as:</p><ul><li>We only invest in the best managers</li><li>We never pay above X times earnings</li><li>Private equity creates more jobs than any other industry</li><li>and much more&#8230;</li></ul><p>But you soon come to realise that this conventional wisdom isn&#8217;t wisdom at all; it&#8217;s all convention. If you stick to the fundamentals, stick to creating lasting value for great businesses, and stick to your personal ethics, you&#8217;ll go much much further.</p>
