<<p>Private equiteers need at least an ounce of entrepreneurial blood to handle the travails of the private equity industry and to make, manage and exit great investments. <strong>This ounce of said blood has its downfalls though</strong>; it constantly pulls at the strings of a private equiteer&#8217;s ambition. He/she spends so much time looking for great businesses, helping them improve performance and guiding business owners to riches that he/she often dreams of being in the opposite position.</p>
