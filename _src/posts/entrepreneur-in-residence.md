<p>You may see the term <em>entrepreneur in residence (EIR)</em> bandied around from time to time. In the broad strokes, it simply refers to a person with extensive entrepreneurial experience interning with a private equity or venture capital fund to learn the <em>game</em>. The word <em>interning</em> is used loosely because <strong>EIRs (<em>entrepreneur in residence)</em> often have deep business experience and are really only interning to learn the distinct skills of a private equiteer or venture capitalist </strong>(deal making, running a fund, etc.)</p><p>The (<em>entrepreneur in residence) </em>EIR term triggers a question in my mind: how disparate are the skill sets of entrepreneurs and private equiteers? Also, irrespective of how disparate they are, how disparate should they be?</p><p>In times of unpleasantness (now), I really think <strong>private equiteers need to get their hands dirty</strong>. And, to be a part of the solution, rather than the problem, the private equiteer needs some serious entrepreneurial nous. Standing on the proverbial pedestal <strong>proclaiming to add value only via deal making is a sure way to differentiate your firm on the downside</strong>. Of course, someone still needs to run the fund from an administrative, regulatory and financial viewpoint, and this takes a specialist skill set, but your firm needs much more than that to differentiate in this market. Do you think an <em>entrepreneur in residence</em> make sense?</p>
