<<p>In one of my previous posts about private equity analysis (apparently everything is counter-cyclical now), I talked about approaching potential investees and hearing that almost all of their businesses were counter-cyclical. Of course I was sceptical, and of course, the chickens have come home to roost now.</p><p>Implicit in this theme is the concept of correlation vs. causation. That is, the difference between <strong><strong>a) two correlated</strong> variables</strong>, and <strong><strong>b) one variable causing another variable</strong></strong>. Some business owners would see a drop in economic growth and then an increase in their sales and assume their business was counter-cyclical. This is a simple correlation test. But thinking along the lines of causation, maybe a drop in GDP doesn&#8217;t lead to an increase in motor yacht sales or beach homes. <strong><strong>Maybe the correlation was simply the result of a lag or government deficit spending</strong></strong>.</p><p>So today&#8217;s hint (to self and others) is to consider causation rather than correlation in private equity analysis. Moreover, <strong><strong>don&#8217;t be bedazzled by statisticians with regression models claiming causation</strong></strong>. Use some common sense and don&#8217;t be too afraid of relying on impartial anecdotal evidence. You may have learned to live and die by facts in b-school, but we all know the importance of gut feel.</p>
