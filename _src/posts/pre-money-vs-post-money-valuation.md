<p>Private equity valuation sounds simple enough, so what&#8217;s all this talk of pre-money vs post-money? How can a business have a different valuation at the same point in time?</p><p>It generally comes down to the purpose and use of your investment. There are two broad options:</p><ol><li><strong>Existing Capital</strong> &#8211; e.g. buy-out an existing stockholder, retire some debt, etc.</li><li><strong>New Capital</strong> &#8211; e.g. invest for growth, invest to make an acquisition, etc.</li></ol><p>If you swap your new capital for existing capital (buying out another shareholder or paying down debt), then there&#8217;s generally no change to the valuation. However, <strong>if you are investing cash as new equity</strong> (for growth and/or acquisitions), <strong>then you&#8217;re increasing the equity value</strong> of the business and hence, increasing the EV and overall valuation.</p>
