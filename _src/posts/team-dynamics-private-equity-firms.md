<p>I wrote a post recently called the aftershock of hard negotiations. The general premise being, if you must live with vendors in the future (as part owners), then <strong>it&#8217;s wise to think of your future relationship when negotiating</strong>. (Even if you don&#8217;t live with them, you should still be decent, but that&#8217;s not nearly as convincing.)</p><p>So, with that in mind, I want to comment on negotiations again, but <strong>in the context of your internal private equity firm&#8217;s team dynamics</strong>. There are a few points to consider here:</p><ul><li><strong>Team members are acutely aware of your negotiation tactics</strong> (and most tactics in general), so when you try to use them internally, it leads to instant contempt</li><li><strong>Your negotiation style becomes a part of you</strong> when you&#8217;re dealing with potential investees all day, so it&#8217;s not always easy to turn it off when dealing with your team dynamics</li><li>You are married to your team dynamics; you aren&#8217;t selling them a set of encyclopedias; so, even though you may have superior negotiation skills, your team will be there tomorrow to resent you if you treat them unfairly</li><li><strong>Your team talks</strong>; there are cliques you can&#8217;t even see; don&#8217;t treat anyone in a way you wouldn&#8217;t want everyone else to know about</li><li><strong>In deals and in life, you often benefit much more from not getting your way</strong></li></ul><p>Too often we focus on the tangible and don&#8217;t acknowledge the potential value in maintaining good relations. Just food for thought for now.</p>
