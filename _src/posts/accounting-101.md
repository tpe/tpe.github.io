<<p>Part of being diligent with detail is understanding each and every line of detail. <strong>Understanding each line means you can pinpoint problems and create surgical solutions. </strong>For example, if you find that gross profit is much lower in one region than the others, you know that you have to investigate COGS in that region. I realise that this is topic is Accounting 101, but like many things, it&#8217;s worth being said for the reminder. So without further adieu, here&#8217;s how a dollar of revenue turns into less than a dollar of NPAT:</p><h2> Accounting 101</h2><ul><li>Revenue (or sales or turnover or the &#8220;top line&#8221;)</li><li><em>minus </em>Cost of Goods Sold (or COGS or variable costs)</li><li>= Gross Profit (or GP)</li><li><em>minus</em> Expenses (or overheads or operating costs or fixed costs)</li><li>= Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation &amp; Amortization (or EBITDA)</li><li><em>minus</em> Depreciation &amp; Amortization</li><li>= Operating Profit (or OP)</li><li>plus/minus abnormal revenue/costs</li><li>= Earnings before Interest &amp; Tax (or EBIT)</li><li><em>minus</em> Interest of debt</li><li>= Net Profit before Tax (or NPBT)</li><li><em>minus </em>Taxation</li><li>= Net Profit after Tax (or NPAT or NP or the &#8220;bottom line&#8221;)</li></ul>
