<p>It&#8217;s my job to invest on the best possible terms. In fact, I have a fiduciary duty to invest well. Remember, most <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/types-of-investors/">VC and PE money</a> comes from institutions. Those institutions give me money according to a mandate. And that mandate demands I turn straw into gold by investing in you.</p><p>While I have a fiduciary duty to my investors, I don&#8217;t have duties to you as a founder. Sure, it&#8217;s in my best interests to do well by you, but don&#8217;t forget where my loyalties lie. This isn&#8217;t some sleazy injustice, it&#8217;s just the way things are. Don&#8217;t fight it, just level the playing field by learning the <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/private-equity/">tricks of the trade</a>.</p><h2>Investor Tricks #1 to #4</h2><p>In Part 1 (<a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/investor-tricks/">Investor Tricks #1 to #4</a>), I spoke about tactics used by investors to create the perception of closing the <em>value gap</em>. That means, we investors create the illusion that we&#8217;re meeting your price when in fact we&#8217;re engineering the term sheet to manipulate your perception.</p><p>In this article, Part 2, I&#8217;ll delve even further into these term-sheet tricks.</p><h2>Why Reveal these Secrets?</h2><p>I&#8217;m not writing this to antagonize founders. Quite the opposite. I want to prepare you to talk with investors one-on-one. I don&#8217;t want lawyers getting their sticky fingers on our relationship. Sure, you should absolutely confirm terms with a lawyer, but let&#8217;s not get into a fee-frenzy where our <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/private-equity-legal/">lawyers justify their existence</a> at our expense. Apart from cost, we also start off on the wrong foot.</p><p>After I invest in a great founder, my #1 objective is to become part of the team. When you have a problem, I want you to call me first without even taking a breath. We&#8217;re in this together. Tricky term sheets, adversarial lawyers, and asymmetric information only attempt to destabilize our common objective.</p><p>Now, let&#8217;s get back to spilling the beans.</p><h2>Trick #5: Employee Stock Options</h2><p>You want me to invest $5 million at a $10 million valuation, but I want to invest for much less.</p><blockquote><p>Okay, I&#8217;ll meet your expectation and invest $5 million at a <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/pre-money-vs-post-money-valuation/">pre-money valuation</a> of $10 million, which includes a stock option pool (25% of the post-money value). We&#8217;ll use the option pool to build a superstar team and achieve world domination. Sound good?</p></blockquote><p>See what&#8217;s happening here? The first trick is including the option pool in pre-money, while the second trick is using a percentage of the (higher) post-money value. Neither makes sense. It means you&#8217;re paying for future growth with value you created in the past (pre-money).</p><p>It&#8217;s not just 25% of $10 million, but 25% of $15 million. Except it comes out of pre-money.</p><p>The real pre-money is now <strong>$6.25 million </strong>(10 &#8211; (10+5) x 25%).</p><h2>Trick #6: Investor Preferred Stock</h2><p>Using the same example from above, you want $5 million at $10 million pre-money.</p><blockquote><p>Okay, I&#8217;ll meet your valuation because I really believe in you. So I&#8217;ll invest at $10 million pre-money buying $5 million of <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/preferred-stock/">preferred stock</a>. Also, because there&#8217;s information asymmetry, and you have more control over the business, I want a 3x preference multiple and coupon of 12% pa. Think of it as an insurance premium.</p></blockquote><p>First off, <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/liquidation-preference-participation/">preferred subordination</a> doesn&#8217;t just matter in bankruptcy. If you only manage to sell the business down the track for say $5 million, you get NOTHING! Subordination means I get my full investment back before you get anything. But, a 3x preference multiple means I have an insurance policy to receive at least 3x my investment. So, even if you sell for $15 million, I&#8217;m entitled to 3x my $5 million investment, so again, you get nothing.</p><p>Secondly, the preferred coupon represents a repayment of my investment. It&#8217;s essentially an ongoing transfer of value from you to me. In this example, the business must pay me $600k per year. This has significant value in today&#8217;s money.</p><p>In this example, you pay me a <strong>huge salary for the privilege of losing your business</strong>.</p><h2>Trick #7: Management Fees</h2><p>Let&#8217;s continue with the same example, $5 million at $10 million pre-money.</p><blockquote><p>Okay, I&#8217;ll meet your expectation &#8230; so I&#8217;ll invest $5 million as preferred stock. Since I bring strategic experience and insight to the team,  should be paid a salary like you, so there&#8217;s a management fee of $250k per quarter. That&#8217;s very cheap given my team&#8217;s deep experience. Plus, it further aligns our interests.</p></blockquote><p>This is the same deal as the coupon, the <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/private-equity-fees/">management fee</a> helps repay the investment. Instead of the coupon at $600k per year, my team receives a &#8220;salary&#8221; of 4 x $250k, which equals $1 million per year. My entire investment is repaid in 5 years and if we only sell for $5 million, it&#8217;s still all mine because my pref stock subordinates your ordinary stock.</p><h2>Trick #8: Putting it all together</h2><p>Same example.</p><blockquote><p>Okay, okay, okay. I love what you&#8217;re doing and think you have an A-class team. I really believe in the business, so let&#8217;s do it.</p><p>Forget my $5 mill pre-money, I&#8217;ll agree to your $10 mill.  A couple of conditions though. Like always, I will have preferred stock with a coupon of 15%. Since we&#8217;re agreeing to your valuation based on your confidence of next year&#8217;s earnings being $3 million, we have a <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/private-equity-ratchet/">ratchet</a> that transfers 1% of equity per $10k below the forecast.</p><p>As mentioned, we also have lots of experience in this industry and excellent contacts. Since we&#8217;ll be working hard alongside you, we need a salary in the form of a management fee, which is $250k per quarter. We&#8217;ll even agree to the same <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/ideal-board-of-directors/">board representation</a>, but we want to appoint an additional independent chairperson.</p></blockquote><p>Firstly, I know what you&#8217;re thinking, this sounds outrageous, it&#8217;s not at all realistic. Well, sorry to break it to you, but this is what MOST of our deals look like. Yes, MOST.</p><p>Let&#8217;s go through it in point form:</p><ul><li>The pref stock means unless you increase value, you&#8217;ll be diluted big time.</li><li>The pref coupon means the company is paying back my investment, while you get nothing.</li><li>The management fee does the same, but increases repayments to $1.75 million/year!</li><li>My investment is repaid in ~3 years, but <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/management-team-importance-private-equity/">you cannot take a cent</a> (aligned interests, etc).</li><li>The ratchet means that unless you produce a miracle and hit earnings of $3 million, you&#8217;ve lost a part (or all) of your business (<a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/investor-tricks">see Part 1</a>).</li><li>The appointment of the independent director tips the board in my favour. Independent? Ha!</li></ul><p>Again, this is what MOST of our deals look like. In fact, there&#8217;s much more once you get into the finer detail. I explain all of those details in the <a href="http://www.theprivateequiteer.com/private-equity/">eBook</a>.</p><p>As I mentioned in Part 1, don&#8217;t assume you&#8217;re too smart to fall for this. I&#8217;m using obvious language here and we do this all day every day. Even your lawyers will miss our tricks.</p><h2>But, Let&#8217;s Remember Something&#8230;</h2><p>Term sheet negotiations aren&#8217;t about what&#8217;s right and wrong. They&#8217;re about a business transaction driven by many interconnected levers. If you pull a lever that&#8217;s important to you (e.g. a right to appoint the CEO), then you must expect me to pull a lever that&#8217;s important to me (e.g. an equity ratchet) in the opposite direction.</p><p>In part, we have these crazy structures because founders read too much news about Groupon et al. with billion-dollar valuations on unstable earnings. Of course, that&#8217;s not the whole story. The investing game is largely about manipulation and under-handed trickery. I want to undo it all and get back to open, upfront and forthcoming discussions.</p><p>As a founder, the most important thing you can do is understand the tricks of the investment trade. Don&#8217;t leave it up to a lawyer, or God forbid, the investor. Be smart and take care of your business.</p>
