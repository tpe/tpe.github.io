<p>There&#8217;s a simple yet particularly salient post over at Carried Interest about exiting founders and business owners and the lack of implied alignment. The age-old question is,</p><blockquote><p>why are you selling your entire business if you&#8217;re young, healthy and ambitious, and if the business and industry have huge potential?</p></blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense when you hear it, read it or think it. Yet, we have to ask this question at least once a week. Sometimes I almost convince myself to ignore it, but it&#8217;s safest to go with common sense and avoid these situations because chances are that the business/industry isn&#8217;t so great and the founder is being opportunistic.</p>
