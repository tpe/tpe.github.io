<!-- START UPDATE -->
<p>In private equity, despite counterarguments about &#8216;investing in the future&#8217;, we aim to spend less because <strong>we see so much waste on a daily basis</strong>. This doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re allergic to investing for growth; rather, our experience shows reducing waste is a more fruitful endeavour (at least at first). We&#8217;d love the exposure of running global ad campaigns or buying corporate jets, but in private equity we deconstruct everything with <strong>our mind firmly on the exit</strong>.</p><p>Consider your private equity exit as the day you can do anything you want: create startups, invest in other businesses, join boards of listed companies, or travel the globe. In order to apply private equity principles to achieve a better &#8216;personal exit&#8217;, you must <strong>learn to want less</strong> (and like it). This sounds like compromising, but it isn&#8217;t. As in private equity, keeping your mind on the private equity exit helps you to see <strong>the real value (approximately none) of instant gratification</strong>. This is the characteristic that creates successful entrepreneurs, investors or even Olympians.</p><p>This concept of deconstructing a problem with a firm view on the private equity exit or desired outcome isn&#8217;t new. Tim Ferriss talks about it incessantly and shows some very interesting real world examples (see his TED talk). And while you may see this as just self-help nonsense, consider that <strong>it&#8217;s built an enduring multi-billion dollar industry</strong> (the private equity industry, not the self-help book industry).</p>
