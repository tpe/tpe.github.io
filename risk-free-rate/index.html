<p>With all the chaos surrounding bank deposit guarantees, I had a thought. At school, most of us learnt to use government securities to determine the risk free rate for use in models that discounted cash flows. Governments are hardly risk-free (I&#8217;m thinking Russia, Argentina, Iceland, et al), but the theory is that they&#8217;re about as close to risk-free as you can get. That is, if the government&#8217;s in trouble, then we&#8217;re all in trouble.</p><p>Well, now with government guarantees on bank deposits, <strong>we effectively have a new risk free rate</strong>. That is, if governments are backing bank deposits, then bank deposits are consequently as safe as government securities. I don&#8217;t know what this means for the world outside of academia, but it&#8217;s an interesting consideration for anyone discounting cash flows.</p><p>The counter argument is, in most countries at least, bank guarantees are limited to a certain amount (e.g. $100,000). You would think this would apply on a per person basis, but most reports seem to suggest this is on a per account basis. So, by creating multiple accounts can circumvent limits. In some countries though, governments have placed a blanket guarantee across all bank deposits, which negates the need for multiple accounts. Either way, I stand by the idea of a new risk-free rate in any country where these guarantees exist.</p>
