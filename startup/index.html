<!-- START UPDATE -->
<p>I mentioned a couple of months ago that I was leaving the world of private equity for the land of startups. <strong>It was a serious move</strong>. I was planning to leave stable employment, consistent income, lots of potential upside (carry), and an established career. But to be frank, it was the easiest decision I&#8217;ve ever made. I never once questioned it or procrastinated. It was automatic; <strong>like tying shoelaces.</strong></p><p>So now after a couple of months, now that the reality has set in, I&#8217;m here to report on the remaining lustre of the dream.</p><p>There&#8217;s no denying that life is challenging now. For starters, I&#8217;m working more hours in a week than I previously worked in a month. And for all this work, I now have no regular income. The work is much more difficult and varied too. I thought life in private equity was varied, <strong>but startup work is coal-face work</strong>; there&#8217;s no advising from afar. You design, implement, execute and improve, everything yourself.</p><p>With all of that said, I wouldn&#8217;t change it for the world. <strong>And that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the ultimate challenge, a startup.</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m now working in an office with a group of other enthusiastic entrepreneurs. And the air is electric. Everyone wants to be here. They&#8217;re giving their businesses everything. They&#8217;re passionate. They&#8217;re talkative. They have ups; they have downs. But they all keep moving forward at such amazing pace that it becomes self-propigating, creating a whirlwind of activity.</p><p>I learnt a lot from private equity and I enjoyed my time in what seems the perfect career. <strong>But startups are like cage fighting</strong>; they&#8217;re primeval and they reach to our roots. Maybe if I had the genetic composition, I&#8217;d have chosen cage fighting instead.</p>
