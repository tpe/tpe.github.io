<p>&lt;<p>I&#8217;ve received a few emails asking this question and just realised it&#8217;s one of the most popular search terms (that generates traffic to The Private Equiteer). The question, as per the search term, sounds a little ambiguous, so let&#8217;s reword it&#8230;</p><p><strong>The question</strong>: <em>should </em>working capital affect an enterprise value calculation.<br
/> <strong>The answer</strong>: absolutely.</p><p>Your calculation of a firm&#8217;s enterprise value must account for working capital because it affects cash flow. And, anything that affects cash flow, affects returns, and anything that affects returns, affects the value of an investment.</p><p>For a full run-down of the nuances of WC vs. EV, check out the Working Capital Series. For a quick and dirty understanding, think about <em>changes</em> in working capital. If you must pay creditors before debtors pay you, there is a drain on cash. All else equal (including revenue), this requires a one time injection of cash to support the perpetual lag in payments. But, if revenue grows (and your working capital profile stays the same), you must inject more cash into the business to support the changes in absolute working capital. This continues as long as growth continues and hence affects the long-term investment value.</p><p>I realise this seems somewhat rudimentary, but the popularity of the search term suggests otherwise.</p><p>Sometimes analysts will acclimatize Action bulk to cover accounts receivables (depends on liquidity, and yes there are humans who buy accounts receivables for cash), and I am abiding if there was a cogent bulk of Accounts payable (something that would accept a actual aberration in the value) it would be adapted for as well. Otherwise, disinterestedness bulk + net debt + boyhood absorption + adopted banal is acclimated as an simple way to see (as you mentioned) how abundant should be paid for the firm.</p><p>In the absolute world, analysts will use accessible comps, accretion comps, dcf, and lbo to get values, and again accretion/dilution assay to see the appulse of a alliance on the new company. For the two atone sets, Action Bulk is a quick and advantageous apparatus to get your multiples. For the DCF and LBO, accounts payable would be congenital in your Free Banknote Flow adding and ultimately into your action value. Finally, accretion/dilution will appearance you the abounding destroyed aftereffect of the accounts payable on the new company&#8217;s EPS. Theoretically, it should be included but the action of Action Bulk is to accommodate a quick and simple answer.</p><p>Equity bulk = banal amount x # of shares outstanding, and the banal of the aggregation is not a alarm advantage on the action bulk of this actual company.</p><p>Besides, affairs the stock, you pay its abounding amount (rather than an advantage premium).</p><p>Then, if we for a minute brainstorm your account were true, we would charge to accept accustomed that action bulk may be advised an basal (on which an advantage is written). This is not that simple &#8211; on the adverse to the disinterestedness bulk (or MCap), EV is not as acutely authentic (so that in altered cases, some portions of liabilities may or may not be advised locations of net debt, for example).</p><p>Then, with options, client doesn&#8217;t accept any obligations (only rights &#8211; afterwards he has paid the premium), while biographer has alone obligations, but no (after he has accustomed the premium). With stock, it is not so: client of the banal (i.e. shareholder) has both and obligations.</p></p>
