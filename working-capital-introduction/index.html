<!-- START UPDATE -->
<p>This is the first post in a series that discusses working capital. <strong>The purpose of the series is to deliver a congruent and clear theory on how working capital fits into a private equiteer&#8217;s analyses. </strong>I plan to make practicable and thoughtful points that (hopefully) don&#8217;t regurgitate finance textbooks. So, if deep down, working capital is still a little bit of a mystery to you, stay tuned.</p><p>The series will broadly adhere to the following structure:</p><ol><li><strong>Overview </strong>- working capital fundamentals that will provide a foundation for more complex discussions</li><li><strong>Dealmaking </strong>- working capital analysis conducted for valuation and settlement purposes</li><li><strong>Investees </strong>- working capital issues for investees including improvements and monitoring</li><li><strong>Exiting </strong>- working capital considerations when exiting an investee</li></ol><p>Although the generic working capital formula is hardly rocket science, it can be quite difficult to understand its exact dynamics in relation to valuation methodologies and other private equity topics. In some instances, it is vitally important to consider working capital, whereas in others it doesn&#8217;t really matter (more on that later in the series).<strong> Lastly, more than working capital itself, it is critical to understand its drivers and their own influences on value and ongoing performance. </strong></p>
