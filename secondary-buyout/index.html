<p>&lt;<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but <strong>the idea of secondary buyouts seems completely perverse</strong>. The only exceptions I can imagine are mandate issues (e.g. the investee is becoming too large for the fund to support) or if there is a logical secondary buyer with a specialist skill set that may be able to realise further value. In all other cases, if one private equity firm can&#8217;t extract value, then why would another firm believe they can (egos aside for a minute)?</p><p>We&#8217;ve had a few secondary buyout approaches at my firm from other private equity firms for secondary deals, but if I&#8217;m looking for the best deals available, <strong>I&#8217;m certainly not thinking of buying businesses that other private equity firms reject</strong>. These are smart people and you have to give them some credit. Sure, there are other arguments, such as the business may make sense as a bolt-on to another investee, but for a private equity firm to sell an investee at a deep discount in a secondary buyout, there must be serious concerns.</p><p>With all of that said though, <strong>I&#8217;m sure there have been successful secondary buyouts</strong> and I&#8217;m certain that the bigger private equity firms often don&#8217;t have a choice but to consider the secondary buyout. There&#8217;s also the case of selling non-core business units, but I don&#8217;t really consider these as secondary deals. The types of deals that I question are those where a private equity fund buys a primary investment from another fund and the acquirer doesn&#8217;t have a materially different mandate or a more applicable strategic offering to make secondary buyouts worth it.</p></p>
