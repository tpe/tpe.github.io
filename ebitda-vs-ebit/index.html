<p>&lt;<p>The problem with any measure from the P&amp;L statement (such as EBITDA, EBIT and NPAT) is that <strong>they rarely represent cash flow</strong>. Cash flow is important because we like to understand returns from a cash, rather than paper, perspective. However, measuring maintainable cash flow from the financial statements can be inaccurate and difficult, especially with public companies. Therefore, <strong>we&#8217;re often relegated to using P&amp;L measures</strong>.</p><p>With this in mind, the major problem with EBITDA is that it has no provision for capital expenditure. <strong>Capex is a major cash item that doesn&#8217;t make it onto the P&amp;L statement</strong>Â (until later in the form of depreciation) because capital assets are capitalised to the balance sheet. Some capital-intensive companies have huge capex, so knowing that EBITDA is $10m may be inconsequential. That company&#8217;s capital-spend alone could be $9m, leaving cash of only around $1m (all else being equal).</p><p><strong>The advantage of EBIT (vs EBITDA) is that it somewhat accounts for capex through depreciation</strong>. This depreciation figure often represents a <em>smoothed</em> measure of capex since it accounts for items purchased over many years. So, in short, <strong>EBIT is a much better measure of real earnings</strong>, even if still a little inaccurate. (These other inaccuracies come from various deviations between cash and accrual accounting.)</p><p>For most companies, the disconnection between EBITDA and cash flow is too wide to be of any real use. <strong>The only exception I can imagine is using EBITDA in the analysis of businesses within the same industry</strong> where capex to revenue ratios are similar. In those cases, it is more feasible to use EBITDA, but still not ideal.</p><p>Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.
