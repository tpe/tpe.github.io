<p>&lt;<p>I just read a great quote by Jim Rogers, of Adventure Capitalist fame, and thought you may find it somewhat motivating (or de-motivating, depending on your situation), especially in relation to your fit for working in private equity.</p><blockquote><p>If you ask a thousand people if they want to be rich, every one except the poet and the mystic will say yes. When you explain what is needed to become rich, maybe <strong>600 of that initial 998</strong> will say, &#8220;No problem, I can do that.&#8221; But when push comes to shove, when they have to sacrifice everything else in their lives&#8211;having a spouse and children, a social life, possibly a spiritual life, maybe every pleasure&#8211;to meet their goal, almost all of them, too, will fall away. Only <strong>about six of the original thousand</strong> will continue on the hard path.</p><p>Most of us don&#8217;t have the discipline to stay focused on a single goal for<strong> five, ten, or twenty years</strong>, giving up everything to bring it off, but that&#8217;s what&#8217;s necessary to become an Olympic champion, a world-class surgeon, or a Kirov ballerina&#8230;</p><p><strong>Such goals take complete dedication.</strong></p></blockquote><p>While Rogers&#8217; goal may have been to become rich, and while many of us think we&#8217;re after more noble pursuits (though mostly we&#8217;re just being righteous), it&#8217;s hard to deny Jim&#8217;s truth. Working in private equity takes something special because it&#8217;s such a niche sought after field.</p></p>
