<p>p&gt;In private equity, we make <strong>primary </strong>investments and <strong>bolt-on</strong> investments. A primary investment is a direct investment of cash into a new business (often in a new industry). A bolt-on investment is an investment via an existing portfolio company into a business that presents strategic value (usually in the same industry).</p><p>Primary investments get most of the press. But, many private equity funds spend just as much cash on bolt-on investments. And, <strong>bolt-ons have the potential to create much more value </strong>(I&#8217;ll explain why later). So, it pays for a private equiteer to give up some of the glitz and glamour of primary investments to become a quiet achiever through bolt-ons. Here are a few of my thoughts:</p><ul><li>Bolt-on acquisitions are usually smaller businesses, which attract <strong>lower multiples with better terms</strong></li><li>Bolt-on acquisitions provide the chance to create instant value (by acquiring lower multiple businesses <strong>using a higher multiple vehicle</strong> &#8211; see Public versus Private multiples)</li><li>Bolt-on acquisitions often <strong>require less work</strong> because they are smaller and attract less competition</li><li>Bolt-on acquisitions offer strategic value (revenue and cost synergies), meaning <strong>you can pay a little more </strong>and be more successful in an auction process</li><li>Bolt-on acquisitions provide for <strong>easier due diligence</strong> since you have access to industry experts in your primary investment vehicle (access to this experience is invaluable)</li><li>Bolt-on acquisitions owners are <strong>more likely to do a deal</strong> with a larger industry player, since there is prestige in being part of a leading firm (compared to being gobbled up by financial vultures)</li><li>Bolt-on acquisitions give you <strong>access to a whole new market of potential investees</strong> as certain mandated restrictions (regarding size) don&#8217;t apply</li></ul><p>With that said, there are countless studies lamenting the destruction of value that occurs daily via mergers and acquisitions. So, it&#8217;s imperative to maintain focus on likely integration issues and ensure there&#8217;s a cultural fit. See my post in which I describe most bolt-ons as <em>clip-ons </em>(citing their failure to integrate and lack of strategic fit.)</p></p>
