<p>&lt;<p>I am totally into Customer Development at the moment. Well, I hope it&#8217;s been for more than a moment and I hope it&#8217;s for more than a moment more. Anyway, I&#8217;ve been devouring Steve Blanks&#8217; blog lately, which has a great focus on Customer Development and how it should work in practice. The underlying theory (okay, it&#8217;s not theory, it&#8217;s fact) is that <strong>an entrepreneur should live and breathe the customer</strong>. Not in a <em>warm and fuzzy l</em><em>ove thy neighbour</em> way, but more in a <em>they pay the bills and make my business awesome therefore they are my business</em> way.</p><p>One of my previous posts talks about responding to investee underperformance and keeping the focus on building a great business. Well, there&#8217;s a lot that comes to mind that opposes this idea and only a few things that come to mind that are in sync with the idea. Customer Development is in sync.</p><p>I can&#8217;t even nearly do it justice, so here&#8217;s the link to Steve&#8217;s Customer Development blog posts. Also, check out his slides that explain Customer Development in more detail. Enjoy.</p><p>http://steveblank.com/category/customer-development/</p></p>
